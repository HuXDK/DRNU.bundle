dr.dk/nu Plex Plugin
====================

Provides access to the content available from dr.dk/nu.

Most content is freely available, but some of the content might not be
viewable outside of Denmark.

Installation
============

With Git (Recommended):
cd ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/
git clone git://github.com/maxandersen/DRNU.bundle.git

With Zip (Only if Git scares you): 
Download https://github.com/maxandersen/DRNU.bundle/zipball/master
Unzip content into ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/

Now Plex should see the DRNU plugin.
